# Code smell ledger

Durable record for the smell-hunt loop (`.ctrlyoke/templates/smell-hunt-loop.ctrlyoke.yaml`).
Each pass reads this before proposing work, so it never re-proposes something already
deferred or ruled out. One bullet per smell: files involved and a one-line reason.

## Passes

- **2026-11-08, pass 1** — hunted the harness layer and shared helpers. Fixed directly:
  `CopilotNotificationMonitor.buildHookConfig` re-implemented the base class's
  `encodePermissionRequestHook`; single-sourced matching JSON type guards and number
  parsers in `src/utils/JsonTypeGuards.ts`. Also routed exact inline
  `instanceof Error ? … : String(…)` source copies through `getErrorMessage` in
  `src/utils/ErrorUtils.ts`, removing five private copies across CLI, core, server and
  utilities while updating source call sites across workers and UI.
- **2026-11-08, pass 2** — reviewed pass 1's two refactors (behavior preserved). Cleaned
  up: four files failed Prettier, five imports had landed above file-header comments,
  two cross-module `export { isRecord }` re-exports (`WorkflowLocationTypes.ts`,
  `AntigravityTranscriptTypes.ts`) were replaced by direct `JsonTypeGuards` imports,
  four one-line `getErrorMessage` wrappers (`errorText`/`describeError`) were inlined,
  and webview imports of `ErrorUtils` now use the `@root/utils` alias. Hunted Node errno
  handling, webview step guards and the webview paged-listing hooks; queued three steps
  (errno-code helpers, `isScriptStep` copies, paged-hook helpers + `toError`).
  The errno-code refactor landed in `src/types/DashboardConstants.ts` and
  `src/utils/ErrorUtils.ts`, with source call sites and coverage updated.
  The six webview `isScriptStep` copies now use the generic core guard from
  `src/types/CtrlYokeTypes.ts`; focused guard coverage was added.

## Deferred

- `src/ui/webview-react/hooks/usePaged{CommitHistory,FileHistory,GitRefDiff,WorkspaceDirectory}.ts`
  — the four hooks re-implement the same page cache / abort / in-flight / expiry state
  machine around per-hook `responseIsUsable` checks. Collapsing them into one generic
  `usePagedListing` hook is a design change; only their identical leaf helpers were
  queued in pass 2.

## Ruled out

- `isRecord` in `src/core/harness/copilot/CopilotQuotaClient.ts` — deliberately accepts
  arrays (it only probes RPC error objects for `.code`); different meaning from the shared
  plain-object guard.
- `isScriptStep` in `src/completions/WorkflowFileCompletionCore.ts` — checks raw parsed
  YAML/JSON nodes, not typed workflow steps; keep it separate from the core type guard.
- `isPlainObject` in `src/core/harness/opencode/OpenCodeInlineConfig.ts` and
  `src/ui/webview-react/utils/structuralSharing.ts` — also check the prototype
  (`Object.prototype` or `null`), which the generic guard does not; those callers need it.
- `scripts/*.mjs` copies of `isPlainObject`, `escapeRegExp`, `sleep`, `formatDuration` —
  standalone build scripts that must not import from `src/`.
- `QwenNotificationMonitor` building its node command without quotes while Copilot inlines
  quoted bash/PowerShell commands — intentional: each harness's hook runner parses the
  command differently (comments in both files explain why).
- `isRecord` in `src/core/harness/antigravity/AntigravityStreamJsonUsage.ts` and
  `src/license/LicenseService.ts` — their local `JsonRecord` aliases carry readonly or
  required fields; replacing them with `Record<string, unknown>` would widen/change the
  type guard contract.
- `instanceof Error` message handling outside the exact shared pattern — stack-preserving
  branches, literal fallbacks, error normalization and type checks have different output
  or purpose. Exact matches in `scripts/recover-runs-from-search-index.mjs` and test files
  were left outside this source refactor's scope; `src/utils/ErrorUtils.ts` retains the
  shared helper's own implementation.
- `export { isRecord }` in `src/utils/ctrlyokeToolViews/shared.ts` — kept on purpose:
  that file is the tool-views module's shared barrel and ten sibling models import
  `isRecord` alongside `tryParseJson` from it.
- `normalizePath` in `src/ui/webview-react/utils/promptUndo.ts`,
  `src/core/orchestration/HistorySearchFilters.ts` and `src/utils/CliEventNormalizer.ts`
  — each normalizes differently (lower-casing, trailing-slash trimming, optional input);
  same name, different meaning from the paged hooks' `./`-stripping copy.
- Inline `new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms))` sleeps (about 15 sites across
  core, harness and utils) — one-line idiom; a shared helper would save nothing.
