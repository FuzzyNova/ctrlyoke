# Code smell ledger

Durable record for the smell-hunt loop (`.ctrlyoke/templates/smell-hunt-loop.ctrlyoke.yaml`).
Each pass reads this before proposing work, so it never re-proposes something already
deferred or ruled out. One bullet per smell: files involved and a one-line reason.

## Passes

- **2026-11-08, pass 1** — hunted the harness layer and shared helpers. Fixed directly:
  `CopilotNotificationMonitor.buildHookConfig` re-implemented the base class's
  `encodePermissionRequestHook`. Queued: single-sourced JSON type guards
  (`isRecord`/`asFiniteNumber`), and routing inline `instanceof Error ? … : String(…)`
  copies through `getErrorMessage` in `src/utils/ErrorUtils.ts`.

## Deferred

_None yet._

## Ruled out

- `isRecord` in `src/core/harness/copilot/CopilotQuotaClient.ts` — deliberately accepts
  arrays (it only probes RPC error objects for `.code`); different meaning from the shared
  plain-object guard.
- `isPlainObject` in `src/core/harness/opencode/OpenCodeInlineConfig.ts` and
  `src/ui/webview-react/utils/structuralSharing.ts` — also check the prototype
  (`Object.prototype` or `null`), which the generic guard does not; those callers need it.
- `scripts/*.mjs` copies of `isPlainObject`, `escapeRegExp`, `sleep`, `formatDuration` —
  standalone build scripts that must not import from `src/`.
- `QwenNotificationMonitor` building its node command without quotes while Copilot inlines
  quoted bash/PowerShell commands — intentional: each harness's hook runner parses the
  command differently (comments in both files explain why).
